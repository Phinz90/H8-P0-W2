    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>I graduated from a Private University in Surabaya as a Bachelor of Education. At first I didn't think that teaching is the path I had to take after I graduated, and lately I found out that teaching is not my passion. So Today, here I take a programming class at Hacktiv8, because I want to learn about coding and I found that it's interesting and challenging for me. I feel so fortunate to be here to learn code and programming, and I'm looking forward to see the result become a real programmer.</p>

      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>I was born as a healthy and normal baby, but there was an accident when I was a child that led me to grow up frail along with short term memory. I fell from my bed when I was only 2 months old. Since then, my body often shook and my legs were weak so that I needed leg braces and a pair of shoes made of iron that are usually used for people who get polio. The condition of my brain wasnâ€™t strong either because I had difficulty memorizing simple things such as classes or even the spelling of my own name.
